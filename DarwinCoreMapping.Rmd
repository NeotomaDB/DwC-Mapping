# DwC Alignment:

The Neotoma Paleoecological database represents a rich source of data to researchers and the public who may be interested in biodiversity, biogeography and temporal and spatial ecology at long time scales.  The data crosses multiple allied disciplines, from archaeology, geography, biology, paleontology, ecology and, primarily, paleoecology.  The breadth of utility for this data is potentially hampered by the reliance on a single source of access for the data.

To broaden the availability of data from Netoma, we are working with the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF).  GBIF is an international organization that partners with a number of organizations to make biodiversity data available online.  The use of clear metadata standards, like DarwinCore, make GBIF a useful resource, and the increased size of the data holdings further improve its utility for researchers working on global biodiversity research.

There are three key steps in making Neotoma data available through GBIF.  The first is mapping Neotoma data holdings and concepts onto the metadata standards within GBIF.  This current document is based on [key metadata terms provided by DarwinCore](http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/), and the ways in which the can represent Neotoma data, across dataset types.  In cases where the current implementation of DarwinCore (or other existing metadata standards such as DublinCore) fails to represent important concepts within Neotoma, we describe new terms that can be used to supplement existing metadata.

The second step is simply scraping the Neotoma Database, both at the dataset level for the initial push, but then secondarily, keeping GBIF up-to-date with Neotoma holdings.

<object data="images/DwC_Upload.svg" type="image/svg+xml">
  <img src="images/DwC_Upload.png" />
</object>

To then undertake the mapping of the records, we build a `csv` file for upload, from each individual record within Neotoma using the following mapping:


# Fully Described Output

This is the direct mapping used to generate the Neotoma export to VertNet/DarwinCore.  In places the tables and documents refer to the mapping of various DarwinCore terms to tables and fields within the Neotoma Database.  Neotoma is a SQL Server 2014 database, the format used to refer to specific fields is `XXX.yyy:zzz`, where `XXX` refers to the specific database, in most cases `NDB` for the Neotoma Database.  `yyy` refers to the tables within the Neotoma Database, while `zzz` refers to the specific field within the table.  There is more detail on the related tables within [the online Neotoma Database manual](neotoma-manual.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).

## Taxon

| Implemented | Neotoma | DarwinCore | Description |
| ----------- | ------- | ---------- | ---------- |
|  | | taxonID | An identifier for the set of taxon information (data associated with the Taxon class). May be a global unique identifier or an identifier specific to the data set. |
|  | `Taxa:TaxonID` | scientificNameID | An identifier for the nomenclatural (not taxonomic) details of a scientific name. |
|  | | acceptedNameUsageID | An identifier for the name usage (documented meaning of the name according to a source) of the currently valid (zoological) or accepted (botanical) taxon. |
|  | | parentNameUsageID | 	An identifier for the name usage (documented meaning of the name according to a source) of the direct, most proximate higher-rank parent taxon (in a classification) of the most specific element of the scientificName. |
|  | | originalNameUsageID | An identifier for the name usage (documented meaning of the name according to a source) in which the terminal element of the scientificName was originally established under the rules of the associated nomenclaturalCode. |
|  | | nameAccordingToID | An identifier for the source in which the specific taxon concept circumscription is defined or implied. See nameAccordingTo. |
| * | `Taxa:PublicationID` | namePublishedInID | An identifier for the publication in which the scientificName was originally established under the rules of the associated nomenclaturalCode. |
|  | | taxonConceptID | An identifier for the taxonomic concept to which the record refers - not for the nomenclatural details of a taxon. |
| * | `Taxa:TaxonName` | scientificName | The full scientific name, with authorship and date information if known. When forming part of an Identification, this should be the name in lowest level taxonomic rank that can be determined. This term should not contain identification qualifications, which should instead be supplied in the identificationQualifier term. |
|  | | acceptedNameUsage | The full name, with authorship and date information if known, of the currently valid (zoological) or accepted (botanical) taxon. |
|  | | parentNameUsage | 	The full name, with authorship and date information if known, of the direct, most proximate higher-rank parent taxon (in a classification) of the most specific element of the scientificName. |
|  | | originalNameUsage | The taxon name, with authorship and date information if known, as it originally appeared when first established under the rules of the associated nomenclaturalCode. The basionym (botany) or basonym (bacteriology) of the scientificName or the senior/earlier homonym for replaced names. |
|  | | nameAccordingTo | The reference to the source in which the specific taxon concept circumscription is defined or implied - traditionally signified by the Latin "sensu" or "sec." (from secundum, meaning "according to"). For taxa that result from identifications, a reference to the keys, monographs, experts and other sources should be given. |
|  | | namePublishedIn | A reference for the publication in which the scientificName was originally established under the rules of the associated nomenclaturalCode. |
|  | | namePublishedInYear | The four-digit year in which the scientificName was published. |
|  | | higherClassification | A list (concatenated and separated) of taxa names terminating at the rank immediately superior to the taxon referenced in the taxon record. |
|  | | kingdom | The full scientific name of the kingdom in which the taxon is classified. |
|  | | phylum | The full scientific name of the phylum or division in which the taxon is classified. |
|  | | class | |
|  | | order | |
|  | | family | |
|  | | genus | |
|  | | subgenus | |
|  | | specificEpithet | |
|  | | infraspecificEpithet | |
|  | | taxonRank | |
|  | | verbatimTaxonRank | |
| * | `Taxa:Author` | scientificNameAuthorship | The authorship information for the scientificName formatted according to the conventions of the applicable nomenclaturalCode. |
|  | |  vernacularName | A common or vernacular name. |
|  | | nomenclaturalCode | The nomenclatural code (or codes in the case of an ambiregnal name) under which the scientificName is constructed. Recommended best practice is to use a controlled vocabulary. |
|  | | taxonomicStatus | The status of the use of the scientificName as a label for a taxon. Requires taxonomic opinion to define the scope of a taxon. Rules of priority then are used to define the taxonomic status of the nomenclature contained in that scope, combined with the experts opinion. It must be linked to a specific taxonomic reference that defines the concept. Recommended best practice is to use a controlled vocabulary. |
|  | | nomenclaturalStatus | The status related to the original publication of the name and its conformance to the relevant rules of nomenclature. It is based essentially on an algorithm according to the business rules of the code. It requires no taxonomic opinion. |
|  | | taxonRemarks | Comments or notes about the taxon or name. |
