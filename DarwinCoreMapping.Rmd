# Introduction

The Neotoma Paleoecological database represents a rich source of data to researchers and the public who may be interested in biodiversity, biogeography and temporal and spatial ecology at long time scales.  The data crosses multiple allied disciplines, from archaeology, geography, biology, paleontology, ecology and, primarily, paleoecology.  The breadth of utility for this data is potentially hampered by the reliance on a single source of access for the data.

To broaden the availability of data from Netoma, we are working with the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF).  GBIF is an international organization that partners with a number of organizations to make biodiversity data available online.  The use of clear metadata standards, like DarwinCore, make GBIF a useful resource, and the increased size of the data holdings further improve its utility for researchers working on global biodiversity research.

There are three key steps in making Neotoma data available through GBIF.  The first is mapping Neotoma data holdings and concepts onto the metadata standards within GBIF.  This current document is based on [key metadata terms provided by DarwinCore](http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/), and the ways in which they can represent Neotoma data, across dataset types.  In cases where the current implementation of DarwinCore (or other existing metadata standards such as DublinCore) fails to represent important concepts within Neotoma, we describe new terms that can be used to supplement existing metadata.

The second step is simply scraping the Neotoma Database, both at the dataset level for the initial push, but then secondarily, keeping GBIF up-to-date with Neotoma holdings.

</object>

To then undertake the mapping of the records, we build a `csv` file for upload, from each individual record within Neotoma using the following mapping:


# Mapping DarwinCore to Neotoma

This is the direct mapping used to generate the Neotoma export to VertNet/DarwinCore.  In places the tables and documents refer to the mapping of various DarwinCore terms to tables and fields within the Neotoma Database.  Neotoma is a SQL Server 2014 database, the format used to refer to specific fields is `XXX.yyy:zzz`, where `XXX` refers to the specific database, in most cases `NDB` for the Neotoma Database.  `yyy` refers to the tables within the Neotoma Database, while `zzz` refers to the specific field within the table.  There is more detail on the related tables within [the online Neotoma Database manual](neotoma-manual.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).

|  | | verbatimCoordinateSystem | 	The spatial coordinate system for the verbatimLatitude and verbatimLongitude or the verbatimCoordinates of the Location. Recommended best practice is to use a controlled vocabulary. |
|  | | verbatimSRS | The ellipsoid, geodetic datum, or spatial reference system (SRS) upon which coordinates given in verbatimLatitude and verbatimLongitude, or verbatimCoordinates are based. Recommended best practice is use the EPSG code as a controlled vocabulary to provide an SRS, if known. Otherwise use a controlled vocabulary for the name or code of the geodetic datum, if known. Otherwise use a controlled vocabulary for the name or code of the ellipsoid, if known. If none of these is known, use the value "unknown". |
| * | e.g., `POLYGON ((10 20, 11 20, 11 21, 10 21, 10 20))` | footprintWKT | A Well-Known Text (WKT) representation of the shape (footprint, geometry) that defines the Location. A Location may have both a point-radius representation (see decimalLatitude) and a footprint representation, and they may differ from each other. |
|  |  | footprintSRS | A Well-Known Text (WKT) representation of the Spatial Reference System (SRS) for the footprintWKT of the Location. Do not use this term to describe the SRS of the decimalLatitude and decimalLongitude, even if it is the same as for the footprintWKT - use the geodeticDatum instead. |
|  | | footprintSpatialFit | The ratio of the area of the footprint (footprintWKT) to the area of the true (original, or most specific) spatial representation of the Location. Legal values are 0, greater than or equal to 1, or undefined. A value of 1 is an exact match or 100% overlap. A value of 0 should be used if the given footprint does not completely contain the original representation. The footprintSpatialFit is undefined (and should be left blank) if the original representation is a point and the given georeference is not that same point. If both the original and the given georeference are the same point, the footprintSpatialFit is 1. |
| * | `DatasetPI` | georeferencedBy | A list (concatenated and separated) of names of people, groups, or organizations who determined the georeference (spatial representation) for the Location. |
|  | | georeferencedDate | |
|  | | georeferenceProtocol | |
|  | | georeferenceSources | |

| * | `Taxa:TaxonName` | scientificName | The full scientific name, with authorship and date information if known. When forming part of an Identification, this should be the name in lowest level taxonomic rank that can be determined. This term should not contain identification qualifications, which should instead be supplied in the identificationQualifier term. |
|  | | acceptedNameUsage | The full name, with authorship and date information if known, of the currently valid (zoological) or accepted (botanical) taxon. |

Rules of priority then are used to define the taxonomic status of the nomenclature contained in that scope, combined with the experts opinion. It must be linked to a specific taxonomic reference that defines the concept. Recommended best practice is to use a controlled vocabulary. |
|  | | nomenclaturalStatus | The status related to the original publication of the name and its conformance to the relevant rules of nomenclature. It is based essentially on an algorithm according to the business rules of the code. It requires no taxonomic opinion. |

# Scraping Neotoma

The code runs programmatically, using the script [`functionalized_run.R`](https://github.com/NeotomaDB/DwC-Mapping/blob/master/functionalized_run.R).  The script operates across each dataset within Neotoma, generating a CSV file with the content, as described above.  If the dataset is one of `'geochronologic'`, `'loss-on-ignition'`, `'paleomagnetic'`, `'energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS/EDX)'`, `'X-ray diffraction (XRD)'`, `'X-ray fluorescence (XRF)'`, `'charcoal'`, `'physical sedimentology'`, `'geochemistry'`, and `'water chemistry'`.  These records have no biological information associated with them, and as such will not be exported.

In the case that the SQL query returns a `data.frame` with no content, but is a valid dataset-type, then the returned file is pre-pended with the term `empty`.  As such, a file is generated, but the file is marked as empty.  In cases where the dataset is a valid dataset type, but contains only data from non-biological taxon groups (`"LAB"`, `"LOI"`, `"MAG"`, `"ISO"`, `"BIM"`, `"CHM"`, `"WCH"`, `"GCH"`, `"CHR"`, or `"SED"`), then the record is again returned as `empty`.  `duplicated_` records may be returned if there are Collection Units with duplicated rows.

For other records, a csv is returned with the fields described in the [Final Alignment](#finalign).  Otherwise, the file is written with the name `NNNN_test_YYYY.csv`, where `NNNN` represents the dataset number and `YYYY` represents the dataset type.

# Setting Triggers and Data Upload

As indicated in the [flow chart](#flowchart) above, there will be an initial bulk upload of data to GBIF/VertNet.  Following this initial upload, data will be tracked, based on the initial upload date, and a query will be executed.  If the date of last update within the tables is more recent than the last upload date, then the record will be updated.  However, before the record is uploaded, it will be compared to the original file.  If the files are different, we'll proceed with upload, otherwise, the new file will replace the other locally, but not on GBIF.

# Conclusion

Improving accessibility for Neotoma records is important for the database community.  It provides data contributors with a broader audience for their work, it provides researchers with a broader set of available data.
